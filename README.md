# Branch Predictor Simulator

This project involves developing a simulator to evaluate various branch predictor configurations, including Bi-modal, G-share, and Hybrid predictors. The simulator, implemented using an object-oriented programming approach in C++, forecasts branches based on the program counter.

## Academic Project

This is an academic project under the Microprocessor Architecture course at North Carolina State University (NCSU).

## Features

- **Branch Predictor Configurations**: Supports Bi-modal, G-share, and Hybrid branch predictors.
- **OOP Design**: Utilizes an object-oriented approach for modular and maintainable code.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the accuracy of different branch predictor configurations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Make

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shirazanwar97/BranchPredictorSimulator.git
   cd branch-predictor-simulator
   ```

2. Build the project using Make:

   ```bash
   make all
